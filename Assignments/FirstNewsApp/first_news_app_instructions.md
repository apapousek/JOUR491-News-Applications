#Your first news app: The Harv-O-Tron#

**Background**: Harvey Perlman, the chancellor of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, has pledged to increase the enrollment at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln to 30,000 students. The university, going back to the 1960s, has never had an enrollment higher than 26,000. 

Using data from the UNL Office of Institutional Planning and Research, build a news app that shows where UNL is on this goal and what the trends have been the last few years.

**Requirements**

1. It must look like a professional news application. 
2. It must include actual journalism about Harv's goals. 
3. It must include data.
4. It must visualize that data somehow. 

**Grading notes**

1. You'll at least in part be graded on the effort you put in. If you take the data, slap it on a page, dump a screenshot of an Excel chart in there and toss some text in, you've at best earned a C. 
2. Visualization tools you could use, in order of difficulty: Chartbuilder, Flot, D3. If you've never used D3 before and are struggling with HTML/CSS/Javascript, don't even try it. If you're handling Javascript and HTML okay, try Flot. 
3. Think about what you'd want to see in a site. Photos? Video of Harvey making the goal? Links to documents or websites? Use them.
