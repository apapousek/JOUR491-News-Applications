#Your second news app: You're on your own#

**Background**: This is all you. Make a news app off the news going on in Nebraska recently. Find your own data, make a news app with it. Add journalism to it. 

**Requirements**

1. It must look like a professional news application. 
2. It must include actual journalism -- context, information, analysis, etc. 
3. It must include at least two data sets.
4. It must visualize that data somehow. 
5. This time, vary the layout. Try new things. If it looks like your first news app, that will not go well for you.

**Grading notes**

1. You'll at least in part be graded on the effort you put in. If you take the data, slap it on a page, dump a screenshot of an Excel chart in there and toss some text in, you've at best earned a C. 
2. Visualization tools you could use, in order of difficulty: Chartbuilder, Flot, D3. If you've never used D3 before and are struggling with HTML/CSS/Javascript, don't even try it. If you're handling Javascript and HTML okay, try Flot. 
3. Think about what you'd want to see in a site. Photos? Video? Links to documents or websites? Use them.
